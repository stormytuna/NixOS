# My NixOS Configuration

This is the [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) configuration that currently only runs my personal PC (eva-unit-01). See [my dotfiles](https://github.com/stormytuna/Dotfiles) for the configuration side of things and a more detailed explanation of why I use what I use.

I use NixOS instead of other solutions as it's the easiest to tinker with without breaking stuff. If I want to use KDE Plasma this week, I can simply enable it, and when I decide it's rubbish I can simply disable it. No faffing about with system files. I strongly recommend NixOS if you want to do the same.
