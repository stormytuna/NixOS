-- Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
--
-- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
--
-- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
-- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
--
-- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
-- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
-- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
-- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
--
-- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
--  - Go to definition
--  - Find references
--  - Autocompletion
--  - Symbol Search
--  - and more!
--
-- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
-- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
--
-- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
-- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`

--  This function gets run when an LSP attaches to a particular buffer.
--    That is to say, every time a new file is opened that is associated with
--    an lsp (for example, opening `main.rs` is associated with `rust_analyzer`) this
--    function will be executed to configure the current buffer
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("LspAttach", {
  group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("kickstart-lsp-attach", { clear = true }),
  callback = function(event)
    -- NOTE: Remember that Lua is a real programming language, and as such it is possible
    -- to define small helper and utility functions so you don't have to repeat yourself.
    --
    -- In this case, we create a function that lets us more easily define mappings specific
    -- for LSP related items. It sets the mode, buffer and description for us each time.
